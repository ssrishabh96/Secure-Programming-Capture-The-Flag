# Secure-Programming-Capture-The-Flag

Bonus exercise for the Secure Programming class in Spring 2019 under the professor Thomas Jones.

I would advise eevryone to first give their efforts in these exercises because these are fun and you get to learn more when you explore new tricks and techniques. At least, that's what I did and enjoyed every second of it. See the solution only when you have an answer and match against mine.

## Capture The Flag (CTF):
The bonus exercise that tests your testing skills, hacking skills, knowledge on computer networking and understanding on network protocols and topologies.
  
## Problem:
Each problem is placed in its own relevant directory and has its own instructions.txt file. 
  
## Solution:
Each problem solution is documented with its answer in the pdf file in the main directory.
